Master Slog,
Some of the other minions have been complaining that the leak in this room is annoying them.
You know I would never complain but they keep coming to me and telling me the water falls right on their torch flames and puts them out.
We tried kidnapping a mason but he escaped while we were sleeping.\nSo, if we could get some money for supplies, I think we could fix it ourselves.
Ever Your Most Loyal Minion,\nHogi
