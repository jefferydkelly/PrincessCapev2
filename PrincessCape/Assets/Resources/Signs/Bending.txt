Head Alchemist's Diary - 4/16/961 AB
In my studies, I have found a most singular facet of these gloves that to my knowledge, no one else has noted.
It seems that when aimed at an object, the gloves form a kind of connection with it that lasts as long as the gloves are active.
I've been able to use them to manipulate the velocity of the blocks as if I were guiding them as they were pulled toward me.
This connection even seems to persist after the gloves are deactivated allowing me to pull it again even if I'm not pointing at it.
More study is required to discover if there are other similar facets to these gloves.
