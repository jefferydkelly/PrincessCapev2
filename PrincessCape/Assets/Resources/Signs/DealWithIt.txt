wait 0.25
Fellow servants of the Great Dragon Slog.\nIt seems some of the new people who don't know how to get back.
So, I came up with this little rhyme.\nIf it's red, they're dead.  If it's blue, step on it and count to two.
Why do I have to wait?\nI hear you thinking it.
I made it that way so idiots wouldn't just move on and off to keep firing balls.
Deal with it,\nHogi
