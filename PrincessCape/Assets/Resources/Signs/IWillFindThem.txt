Head Alchemist's Diary - 7/3/961 AB
It has been made clear to me that some of the minions have been stealing my diary and now, it seems they are posting them on signs.
I have a warning for you.  Turns yourselves in and I may be show you lenience.
If you have not done so by tomorrow, I will hunt you down with my particular set of skills. I can guarantee you it will not be pleasant.
