Head Alchemist's Diary - 4/1/961 AB
After the untimely death of my master Chimes, it has fallen on me, the Great Laz, to serve as Master Slog's Head Alchemist.
On the battlefield, I saw how Sirs Samuel and that Sneak Knight moved around the field with their special gloves.
This could pose a major threat to the Master's defenses.
I will begin redesigning the lab to test new ones against these gloves immediately.
My first test should be to see if they can reach through walls.
