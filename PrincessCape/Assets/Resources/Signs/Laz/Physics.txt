Head Alchemist's Diary - 7/3/961 AB
These gloves still confound me.
According to all known laws of physics, I should not be able to stand atop a box and pull myself along with it.
Yet, somehow I can do that with these gloves.
I know those blasted knights must know of this as well and I just know they call it something stupid like "Box Surfing".
It disgusts me.  I must prepare my defenses.
