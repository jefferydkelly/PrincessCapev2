Fellow Minions of the Great Dragon Slog,
A so-called 'safety lady' came by a week ago and said we can't just have open pits of spikes laying around.
I tried to give her a piece of my mind, yes I did but she kept badgering me.
She told me I had to have a practice jump but she never said where I had to put it.  That'll learn 'er.
Your Ever So Evil Boss,\nHogi
