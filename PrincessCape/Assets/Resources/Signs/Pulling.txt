Head Alchemist's Diary - 6/4/961 AB
I found some minions in my personal lab.
It seems they had passed out drunk just before they could sample some of the chemicals I keep in my vials.
They seem to have pilfered some of the Magic Capes Hogi had me craft for him along with a pair of my gloves from last night's celebration.
Curse those fools!  How many times do I have to remind them to stay out of my room.
They're just like my mother.
Anyways, it seems they could get over the spikes with the capes but couldn't go back without the gloves.
I will have to adjust my traps accordingly.
