Princess Elwynn?  All the bards sing your praises!  You're alive.
In life, I was known as Sir Samuel the Regal.
I was famous for my ability to attract people to my side but what they didn't know was my secret.
With my magnetic Pull Glove, I could draw enemies towards me and occasionally myself towards them.
I have no more need of it.  Please take it and find out how you can become even more attractive.
