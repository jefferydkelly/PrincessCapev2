Princess?  You're alive.  The gods truly are strong.
In life, I was known as Sir Travis of House Strongarm, the Brawn Knight.
Everyone thought my ability to move myself and my enemies around was from my muscles...
But, no, it was truly from a magic item that has been passed down the Strongarm line for generations!
With my magnetic Push Glove, I would push myself and my enemies around making sure no one could get to me.
I have no more need of it.  Please take my true strength and use it to escape this dragon's lair.
